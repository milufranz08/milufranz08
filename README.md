# HI, MY NAME IS MILU. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer living in Dayton, Ohio. My expertise is in building web-based applications and data representations with JavaScript. In addition to my day job, I am the co-founder of [Imagine.Dat](http://www.imagine-dat.com), a Data Visualization Dayton meetup.
